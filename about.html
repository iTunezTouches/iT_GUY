                        Hey there, I'm a passionate and curious individual always on the
                        lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow. I have a deep interest in Engineering, such as
                        "technology and software development," "creative design," "business strategy," or anything else
                        that excites you and makes you happy. Over the years, I’ve found that being adaptable and open
                        to new challenges has helped me thrive both personally and professionally.

                    <p>Currently, Im learning Web development, Photo Editing and Video editing and some other things
                        that will help me, where I get to [be writing codes reading books watching videos creating
                        websites building meaningful applications, will help businesses grow their online presence, or
                        "solve technical problems". My professional journey has not started yet because I am still an
                        Intermediate but I think I will contribute more to the society by creating websites for them
                        editing their photos and other things.

                        I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in What I am Learning
                        is crucial, so I’m always engaged in continuous learning—whether it’s through [watching Videos,
                        having "online courses," "attending physical classes," or "collaborating with peers".</p>
